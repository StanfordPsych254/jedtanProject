#Replication Project Proposal

##Justification

I am interested in this particular experiment as it features topics that directly relate to Human-Computer Interactions, namely spatial navigation and object persistence. These features are contextuallized in smartphone vision, which is a continuously-growing area of study in Human-Computer Interaction. In addition, the methods used align well with my skills - the methods used in the paper suggests the creation of a javascript applet that seems challenging but achievable with my coding capabilities. Replicating this experiment and either verifying/questioning the results achieved by the authors should yield insigns into user interaction in tandem with the psychology associated with smartphone use.

##Description of Stimuli and Procedures, and Challenges

####Stimuli:
IV: Type of transition between icons:

1. Slide-Transition: Outgoing icon moves smoothly offscreen while the incoming slides into view , both in the appropriate direction.
2. Fade-Transition: Old icon fades out of view, and the incoming icon fades into-view.
3. Wipe: Analogous to slide-transition, except icons wipe away without moving from the center of the view.
4. Fade Then Slide: A fading animation folloewd by a sliding animation.
5. Slide Then Fade: A slide animation followed by a fading animation.

DV: Response time (time elapsed from beginning of trial to when participant arrives at final target icon).

####Demographics: 
Participants will be found on Mechanical Turk.

####Procedure:
Participants will first read an online consent form and indicate their consent. Using their keyboard and monitor as input/display tools, they will be shown a display of a 4x4 grid of real world icons. However, users can only see one of the icons, and navigate through the grid using the up-down-left-right keys. The users then go through several trials of navigating a four-icon target path, requiring to travel from a starting icon to and end icon through the two icons in the target path. The time required to traverse these paths is saved and collected as the response time.  

####Challenges: 
The primary challenges that I will be facing in this experiment involve the actual coding of the Javascript. While the concept behind the game, the javascript application will have to be fast and responsive and involve precising timing, image display and game-like interactivity and interaction.
